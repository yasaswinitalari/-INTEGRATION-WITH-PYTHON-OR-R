## I have implemented Power BI integration with Python and R to enhance data analysis, predictive modeling, and advanced visualizations. This integration allows seamless execution of Python and R scripts within Power BI for data preprocessing, machine learning, and statistical analysis.Using Python for AI-driven insights, data transformation with Pandas, and visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn, along with R for statistical modeling and forecasting, this solution enables deeper analytics beyond built-in Power BI functions.This integration enhances data science capabilities, predictive analytics, and custom visualizations, making Power BI a more powerful tool for business intelligence.
